  <h2>Bugs: Fixed</h2>
  <p>These are tests that were formerly in the the "bugs" tab
  but have since been fixed and graduated. Now that they're squashed, they
  should never come back again. If these turn red, we know we screwed
  something up.
  
  <P>Note that some of these tests require user interaction. If
  you're asked to save files, etc.? Just Say No.
